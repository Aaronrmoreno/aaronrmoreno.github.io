PATTERNS Line of work No.03

I design visual systems inspired by loops—narratives that, through repetition, reveal patterns of form, animation, sound, action, or any medium capable of embodying this cyclical property. In the project series PATTERNS, I seek to understand the human experience as a sum of loops of varying sizes, textures, and rhythms, where each repetition holds within it the seed of transformation.

I am particularly interested in that precise moment when the continuity of the cycle is interrupted—the moment when repetition gives way, allowing for something new to emerge. It is in this rupture that the possibility for change and evolution resides. The systems I design reflect this flow: cycles that stretch, distort, and could eventually break, giving place to a narrative of unpredictable consequences. PATTERNS is made out of two pieces: HORIZON and PSYCHLOOP.
