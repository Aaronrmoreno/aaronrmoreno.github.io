## TOUCH

This work consists of a color print created using the reduction woodcut technique which is then scanned, digitally animated, and projected onto the original print, achieving perfect alignment between the virtual and the physical image. The depiction of the wheat field is not merely a landscape, but a formal record of a memory tied to a real place. However, in attempting to reconstruct that experience, the documentary reference—the animated print—gradually replaces the original reality, becoming the new way I remember that day. This superimposition of the physical and the virtual invites one to reflect on the fragility of memory and how reality yields to the documentary record when it surpasses our capacity to recall. The work questions the authenticity of our perceptions and highlights how stories lose details and acquire new connotations with each reinterpretation, evolving into dynamic narratives that may become increasingly detached from reality.Video:
