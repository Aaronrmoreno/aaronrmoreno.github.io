MATERIA Line of work No.01

Something I consider essential in the interpretation of my work is the question of "what am I?". As a result of my search for identity, the answer to this question is composed of two fundamental cores: matter and the concept.
While matter is our foundation, identity gives us purpose. In the balance between what simply is and what we can imagine or construct, lies the origin of this open series, currently composed of six works: AUTOMATON, TOUCH, SEAWEED, OVERLAY, WHAT ARE WE MADE OF and BELONG.
