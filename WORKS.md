My projects delve into fundamental questions about existence, perception, and transformation. I explore the interplay between matter and concept, reality and illusion, repetition and change; using these dynamics I aim to create new narratives and experiences. My work invites reflection on the balances that define us and encourages openness to possibilities that transcend the established. At the core of my practice lies the belief that artificial beauty, in any of its forms, represents the purest act of kindness toward the world around us. This is my principal reason for creating art.
