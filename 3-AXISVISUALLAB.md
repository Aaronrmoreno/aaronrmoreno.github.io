# AXIS.VISUAL LAB

AXIS.Visual Lab is an independent collective of artists founded in 2013 by me Aaron Randy Moreno and my partner Milton Raggi. 

Driven by a deep fascination with technology, we allow it to shape and inspire our creative production.

Our practice often materializes through audiovisual, interactive, and immersive experiences. We specialize in transforming public spaces with video mapping and actively collaborate with visual artists and curators across diverse artistic platforms.

Our mission is to spotlight technology-based art within the Cuban contemporary art scene, fostering greater recognition and gradually building an expansive network dedicated to this innovative genre.

## Note: We are currently working on a new and improved website for Axis. In the meantime, the project archive is temporarily hosted on my partner's website:
