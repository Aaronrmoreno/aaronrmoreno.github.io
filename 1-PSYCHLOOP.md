### PSYCHLOOP

<b>
  
This series draws inspiration from phenakistiscopes to create repetitive, almost hypnotic situations. The events arise from a fixed image rotating on its axis, giving the illusion of movement. Each cycle completes in less than two seconds, and beyond that point, no new information is generated. However, our brain requires more time to process the details and fully grasp what is happening. I am interested in exploring how, through repetition, we can gradually recognize the situation we are in. The loop highlights that crucial moment when we are able to choose to look away, breaking the hypnosis and reconnecting with our capacity for decision-making.
