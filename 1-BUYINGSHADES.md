### BUYING SHADES

This work explores shadow projections as an active part of a perceptual system, using the technique of woodcut printing on transparent acetate sheets. The translucency of the material allows the printed ink to cast enlarged shadows, shifting the focus from the physical print to its immaterial projection. More than a fixed image, the shadow becomes the true outcome of the workâ€”an ephemeral form dependent on light, which questions the relationship between the tangible and the intangible, between the object and its reflection.
