PHOTON Line of work No.02

A photon is the elemental particle of light and all forms of electromagnetic radiation. It can be generated naturally or artificially and represents the smallest and indivisible unit of luminous energy. Based on this idea, I created a series of projects with the sole condition of working with light as a narrative medium.

I have always been fascinated by the limits of our perception and the different ways to trick the brain. In this series I used the interaction between light and matter to create that magic: a narrative shaped by reality, illusion and memory. The series invites to reflect on that precise moment when the emitting source is altered, modifying the perceptual outcomes of reality. This series have currently two artwork: PENVMBRA and TOUCH.
