Aaron Randy Moreno (aka Onerom) is an Afro-Cuban visual artist, born in Havana in 1990 during Cubaâ€™s so-called Special Period. His work combines the foundations of traditional printmaking, learned at the San Alejandro National Academy of Fine Arts, with a continuous exploration of technological possibilities in art, developed during his studies at the University of the Arts (ISA).

His projects explore fundamental questions about existence, perception, and transformation. Through the interplay between matter and concept, reality and illusion, repetition and change, he seeks to create new narratives and experiences. His work invites reflection on the balances that define human experience and encourages openness to possibilities that transcend the established.

At the core of his practice lies the belief that artificial beauty, in any of its forms, represents the purest act of kindness toward the world. This conviction serves as his principal motivation for creating art.
