### Horizon

<b>
  
Horizon is a video art created in collaboration with the artist Piera Riccio. The visual metaphor is constructed from an object thrown into the air, digitally edited so that it appears to gravitate continuously towards the center of the screen. The video is accompanied by a voice-over that narrates the precise moment when a silk tree seed begins its journey. Horizon invites us to reflect on the nature of independence: is it really an absolute state or an illusion shaped by the circumstances around us? Through repetition of movement and narrative, the work becomes a poetic meditation that questions our perception of freedom, the balance between self- determination and environment, and the invisible dynamics that shape our choices.
